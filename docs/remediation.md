# Remediation Suggestions
This document provides remediation suggestions for the vulnerabilities detected by the Automated Cybersecurity Testing Framework.

## General Remediation
- **Implement validation and encryption for CAN packets:** This is the most effective way to prevent a wide range of attacks, including packet sniffing and injection.
- **Use a secure bootloader:** A secure bootloader can help to prevent unauthorized software from being loaded onto the ECU.
- **Implement a firewall:** A firewall can be used to block unauthorized traffic from reaching the ECU.
- **Use a secure coding standard:** A secure coding standard can help to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced into the code in the first place.
